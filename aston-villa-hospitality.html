	<h1>Villa Hospitality</h1>
	<h2>Improving The Search For Matchday Hospitality</h2>
	
	<div id="case-study-summary">
		<h3 class="template-features">The project</h3>
	<p>To improve the hospitality section of avfc.co.uk so fans can view lounges and view availability for specific games. The project involved creating wireframes to present back to Villa new ideas for this section.
		To help present the ideas, I created a prototype to show how the user would flow through the section and to better showcase the new ideas.

		<h3>Welcome Page</h3>
		<p>The main focus was the welcome page to allow fans to search for lounge availability for a specific fixture. If a fan just wanted to browse the lounges then at the bottom they could click to view all lounges and then choose the lounge of their choice.Â 
		</p>
		<h4 class="template-features">Template features</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Search for hospitality via a specific fixture</li>
	<li>Select how many people are coming to help narrow down availability</li>
	<li>Easy access to lounges if fan wants to quickly browse</li>
	</ul>

		<h3>Lounge Listing</h3>
		<p>The idea behind the lounge list was to give fans a quick overview of what each lounge has on offer and also which were available for their selected fixture and at what cost.
			Even if a lounge was sold out for that fixture we decided to still show it. The reason for this was that some fans might have a favourite lounge so showing that it was sold out but allowing them to view what fixtures it was available for, we thought, would be a useful idea and would also boost upsell.</p>
		<h4 class="template-features">Template features</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>Fans search criteria highlighted at the top</li>
			<li>Quick overview of each lounge benefits</li>
				<li>Sold out lounges still shown along with their fixture availability</li>

	<h3>Lounge Details</h3>
	<p>We wanted the detail pages to really show off each lounge. The idea we had was to use 360 imagery at the top of the page to show off the lounge with the option to also see the view from your potential seat in the stand. The idea behind the view live button was that it would change the image to a video of what the lounge was like on a match day to give the fan a real sense of the atmosphere in the lounge on a matchday.
	</p><p>The rest of the page gave fans an overview of the lounge benefits along with the availbility of the lounge for specific fixtures. This would default to your selected fixture if you had chosen one on the welcome page. If the lounge wasn't available for your preferred fixture, the idea we had was to show available lounges, again to improve upsell and stop any dead ends.</p>
