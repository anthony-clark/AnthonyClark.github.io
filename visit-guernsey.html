	<h1>Visit Guernsey</h1>
	<h2>Creating a website to highlight everything that the island of Guernsey has to offer</h2>
	<div id="case-study-summary">
		<h3 class="template-features">The project</h3>
	<p>I was the lead designer on the Visit Guernsey project, coming up with wireframes and designs for each template to present back to the client for sign off. The website needed to be strikingly visual and improve upon the key user journeys such as planning your stay or how to get to the island. It needed to gel with improving Visit Guernsey's own yearly targets and aims.</p>

	<h3>Homepage</h3>
	<p>The homepage was designed to be visually striking. I used brush strokes to give the website that coastal feel and chose colours from their brand guidelines that I felt worked best with each other. This resulted in a website that really stood out amongst its competitors.</p>
	<p>The main idea behind the homepage was to quickly get visitors straight into researching what Guernsey had to offer. The main hero was used to promote key events such as the annual heritage festival, whilst Discover Guernsey pushed visitors straight into planning their visit which was one of the key user journeys identified during the wireframe stage.</p>
		<p>Another idea I added to the homepage was a live social stream which would help keep the homepage fresh. This was used to promote social posts added by people visiting the island to show how visitors were enjoying Guernsey.

	<h3>Listing Pages</h3>
	<p>Listing pages were deisgned to be simple and easy to filter. Each item pulled in a simple description along with the option to view more or share that item with friends or family.</p>

		<p>The filters were designed to cater for each different category. For example, accommodation can be filtered by type, location and amenities where as for something like activities the filters would change accordingly.</p>
		
		<p>We also added a hero area so Visit Guernsey could push a specific local business of their choice. </p>

	<ul>

<div class="screenshot-info sticky-content">
	<h3>Detail Pages</h3>
	<p>The Detail pages needed to really sell items such as accommodation. With this in mind we used hero images to allow Visit Guernsey to showcase items using beautiful large imagery to really show off each item, with more images accessible via an image gallery.</p>
	<p>Visit Guernsey's yearly targets focused on visitors either contacting or viewing the website of businesses so we moved these options to the top of the page so they were easily viewable by visitors.</p>
	<p>Related items are shown on the right of the page to make continued browsing easy if visitors want to move on with their research.</p>
	<h4 class="template-features">Template features</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Eye catching hero imagery</li>

	<h3>View by Map</h3>
	<p>The map needed to be easy for visitors to browse. To help with this, colours were used as a key to make items clearly identified by their category. By using the filters at the top of the page, visitors could drill down to exactly what it was they were looking for.</p>

	<h3>Getting here</h3>
	<p>Another target of Visit Guernsey was to promote ways of getting to the island. The getting here page was created to showcase the key ways to travel to Guernsey, either by specific plane and ferry companies or using a tour operator.</p>
		<p>The page needed to be a clean and simple promotional page that showed clearly each option for the visitor to browse.</p>
	<h4 class="template-features">Template features</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Clear promotion of key companies</li>

	<h3>Tasty Walks</h3>
	<p>Another key reason people visit Guernsey was for walking. With that in mind, I designed a section for the website called Tasty Walks. I re-used the article page but gave it a new skin to make it stand out from the rest of the website.</p>
	<p>Each walk had a full description of the route along with options for visitors to download the audio transcript, audio trail or the route map to help them when they got to Guernsey.</p>
	<h4 class="template-features">Template features</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Template skin to stand out from the rest of the website</li>
