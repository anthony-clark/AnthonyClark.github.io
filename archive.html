		<h3>Visit Guernsey</h3>
		<p>Along with Atomic Design, working from a mobile first approach was also essential. Dealing with the smaller screen first meant the harder layout and design problems were dealt with earlier and allowed for a less problematic design phase. This was a massive time saver when it came to templates such as match centre, fixtures and player profiles.</p>

		<h3>Chester Races</h3>
		<p>My team and I worked collaboratively to produce designs for the website of Chester Races. My aim was to design a website that showcased the atmosphere of  the races but also allowed users, especially new visitors, to find out essential information and ticket availability.</p>

			<h3>Revolution Vodka Bars</h3>
			<p>I was lead designer and frontend developer on Revolution for around 6 years. In that time I worked very closely with Rev on projects ranging from new menus, student and Christmas campaigns, to creating a social competition where people could submit their choice of vodka flavour, getting friends to vote for it.

		<h3>Predictor King</h3>
		<p>Flexible modules were designed for numerous elements such as player profiles. This saved having a number of different modules just to show a player in different pages/slots. Instead I designed one flexible module that could be tweaked using CSS to cater for a number of different scenarios. The same idea was used for features like next/last match modules and promotion modules. This, along with the other processes, led to a more streamlined design and development process.</p>

		<h3>Liverpool Airport</h3>
		<p>This project was essentially a re-skin. I had to add design to their current website in order to  achieve a more modern, vibrant look for a previously tired website.</p>

			<h3>Bolton Whites Hotel</h3>
			<p>I worked on a number of microsites for Bolton Wanderers including the website for the hotel that is within their stadium. They required a website that would showcase their bedrooms and hospitality lounges as well as allowing users to easily book a room or plan an event. </p>

			<h3>Neymar 5s</h3>
			<p>To future proof the platform every symbol in Sketch was ordered and labelled and libraries were created. This will allow other designers to quickly create templates and modules that were consistant and available in the product. Moving forward this will allow future websites using this platform to be created with ease.</p>
