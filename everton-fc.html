		<h3 class="template-features">The project</h3>
	<p>As lead designer on the Everton website I was involved in numerous key projects for the club such as season ticket, kit reveal, pre-season and Christmas campaigns.Â  Over the 10 years, I have created three new website designs and provided feedback to a number of third party partners to keep their websites on brand with the main site.
		My team and I also helped Everton's media team with numerous design assets such as banners, wallpapers, screensavers and many more promotional graphics.</p>

		<h3>2014 main website redesign</h3>
		<p>I led the design on a new website back in 2014. The website featured a new, original horizontal scrolling idea for the homepage. This website was also Everton's first responsive website having being designed from the mobile up.</p>

		<h3>2011 main website redesign</h3>
		<p>This was the first full website I had the chance to design for Everton. I led on the design froma UX and UI point of view and also built a few of the templates. This version of the  website also featured Everton's first ever mobile website which was a separate WAP website. Another big feature was a prominent live social stream called 'Everton Live' which highlighted social posts from Everton or the players and any retweeted or liked social comments by everton</p>

	<h3>Season Ticket Campaigns</h3>
	<p>My involvement revolved around designing and brainstorming numerous ideas for the different season ticket campaigns over the years. Each idea needed to tie into Everton's offline marketing strategy for that season. We won awards for some of the campaign ideas we came up with including the 'Stand Together' campaign, which involved one lucky fan randomly being selected each week to be treated to a surprise visit from an Everton first team player hand-delivering them a season ticket. Video footage was then used to capture the moment they met and was posted on Facebook to generate buzz around future 'drops'.</p>

		<p>Another campaign idea was a personalised video that pulled the fans name and seat location into the footage, persuading that fan to renew their season ticket. Player cameos from Graeme Sharp, Sylvain Distin and Jack Rodwell helped boost the popularity of the campaign. Fans could also send their friends and family the video which added a viral element to the campaign. For every project, we provided Everton with a number of design elements such as banners, wallpapers and much more to help promote season tickets sales.</p>

	<h3>Blue cCrimbo</h3>
	<p>I worked on a number of Christmas campaigns over the years for Everton ranging from designing interactive games with scoreboards such as 'Moyes to the World', to the more substantial 'Blue Crimbo' campaign which gradually turned an illustrated map of Liverpool blue as more fans engaged with the website. Fans could engage by either Tweeting using the hashtag #BlueCrimbo, uploading photos of themselves turning the city blue, buying tickets to a December match or even buying Christmas presents for the blue in their life.

	</p><p>I also created an advent calendar, where behind each door there was something to download that would help turn the city blue, along with animated Christmas cards that could be sent to friends and family.

	<h3>Kit Reveals</h3>
	<p>Initially kit reveal campaigns involved teasing fans with parts of the shirt over a number of days until the final reveal on launch day. For these campaigns I led the design and was involved in coming up with reveal ideas for the club. More recently, templates have been designed enabling Everton themselves to skin up sections of the website into kit reveal pages showcasing the new kit and the fabric it is made in, along with other essential info.

	</p><p>My team and I also helped out with numerous graphical elements from homepage takeovers, banners, wallpapers and splash screen designs to help promote each kit.</p>

	<h3>Pre-season</h3>
	<p>Early Pre-season campaigns involved me designing a tour logo and simple brand that could be applied to related news imagery, banners, splash pages and also the theme of the match centre. In recent years the projects have advanced into microsites where fans can subscribe to either single matches or the full pre-season tour package.

	</p><p>This has involved me working with the UX researcher to optimise the key users journeys for logged in/out users and fans who have subscribed to single or all matches. We needed to make sure there was no pain points for users and that buying games was as simple as possible.</p>

	<h3>End of Season Awards</h3>
	<p>At the end of every season, Everton have an awards event to announce their player, young player and goal of the season. To register votes for each of these categories, my team and I designed a section for the website where fans could submit their choices. Only votes online counted towards each award so we needed to create a section that was easy to browse the different players, view the goals and submit the votes.</p>
