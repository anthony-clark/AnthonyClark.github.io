		<h2>Designing the first fully responsive ecommerce offering in football</h2>
	<p>My role was to lead the design on, initially the pitch visuals that were presented to LFC, and then actual website when we won the tender.
		I worked closely with LFC's in-house team, to design a new online retail store that could stand toe-to-toe with the world's best ecommerce experiences. With 40% of users visiting via mobile or tablet the new website needed to be responsive to cater for these users.</p>

<div class="hero-image playmaker-templates"><h2>Key Templates & Features</h2></div>
<div class="container">
<div class="screenshot-info-left">
	<h3>Homepage</h3>
	<p>The homepage was designed in modules. The idea was that going forward pages could be designed quickly by re-using or customising these modules.</p>

	<p>The main focus of the homepage was the kit promotion. For clubs, the main item of the shop is the kit so I designed the homepage to have kit promotion and the kit builder high up. Working closely with LFC, I designed this area to be flexible to cater for promotion of 3, 2 or just 1 kit depending on which had been revealed or was on sale.</p>
		
	<p>The product carousel was a flexible module that could be skinned to promote a number of key themes such as Father's day, Christmas, or the training range. The promo grid underneath was also designed to be flexible so LFC could promote a range of different features, products or categories.</p>
	<h4 class="template-features">Template features</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Flexible kit area with kit builder</li>
	<li>Customisable product carousels</li>
	<li>Flexible promotional area to surface more products/categories</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="screenshot-info-right">
	<h3>Category pages</h3>
	<p>Using the idea of modules, as seen on the homepage, category pages could be quickly designed and flexibly customised to LFC's needs.</p>

	<p>The hero area was designed to push key promotions for a specific category and the product carousel could highlight certain products LFC wanted to push to shoppers.</p>
		
	<p>Just as on the homepage, the promo grid could be customised to promote any items or sub categories.</p>
	<h4 class="template-features">Template features</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Hero area for key marketing messages</li>
	<li>Product carousel to push key products</li>
	<li>Flexible promotional area to surface more products/sub-categories</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="screenshot-left"><img src="images/playmaker/news-article.jpg" alt="Swansea City article design"></div>

</div>
<div class="container">
<div class="screenshot-info-left">
	<h3>Listing Page</h3>
	<p>Listing pages were designed to be clean so users could easily browse products without any clutter. The view could be switched between showing 4, 3 or 2 items per row depending on the users preference.</p>

		<p>Products could be filtered using simple options that allow the fans to find the exact products they were looking for.</p>
		
			<p>Also at the bottom, modules could be added to cross promote any items or campaigns.</p>
	<h4 class="template-features">Template features</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Streamlined product listing styling</li>
	<li>Simple intuitive filters</li>
	<li>Ability to customise listing view</li>
	<li>Modules can be added to push products/categories</li>
	</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class="container">
<div class="screenshot-info-right">
	<h3>Kit Detail Page</h3>
	<p>The kit detail page was designed to clearly show off the imagery of the shirt along with the options to customise the kit with a player's name or a name of the user's choice. The lettering style could also be changed and badges could be added to their shirt just by pressing a button.</p>

	<p>I also designed a feature that allowed related products to be promoted. In this case users could complete the kit by adding the shorts and socks to their basket along with other products the user might be interested in.</p>
	<h4 class="template-features">Template features</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Prominent shirt imagery</li>
	<li>Personalise your shirt options</li>
	<li>Promoted products to complete the kit</li>
	<li>Modules can be added to push products/categories</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="screenshot-left"><img src="images/playmaker/player-profile.jpg" alt="Stoke City player profile page design"></div>


</div>
<div class="container">
<div class="screenshot-info-left">
	<h3>Fashion Detail Page</h3>
	<p>Similar to the kit detail pages, the product was shown in a clean and clear design. The main difference between the pages was that the personalisation feature was not used on fashion items. This made for an even cleaner look.</p>

	<p>Related products were shown in a similar way allowing the user to complete the look or add other fashion products to their basket.</p>
	<h4 class="template-features">Template features</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Fixtures viewable from a month by month approach</li>
	<li>Each fixture expands to show more match info</li>
	<li>Televised games highlighted in the list</li>
	</ul>
