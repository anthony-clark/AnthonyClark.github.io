		<h2>Creating A World Class Sports Platform</h2>
	<p>A large number of football clubs were due to come out of a long-term contract with the English Football League. Our aim was to create a sports platform ,initially aimed at football, that could be sold to these clubs. My role on this project was to lead the design of this platform from the functionality of each template to the process used to create each template. I also came up with the initial list of Opta widgets and their settings which the team then built on.
		The aim was to create a platform that was so flexible it could cater for each club's needs.</p>
