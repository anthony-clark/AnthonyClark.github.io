		<h2>Creating A World Class Sports Platform</h2>
	<p>A large number of football clubs were due to come out of a long-term contract with the English Football League. Our aim was to create a sports platform ,initially aimed at football, that could be sold to these clubs. My role on this project was to lead the design of this platform from the functionality of each template to the process used to create each template. I also came up with the initial list of Opta widgets and their settings which the team then built on.
	</p><p><strong>The aim was to create a platform that was so flexible it could cater for each club's needs.</strong></p>

	<h3>Atomic Design Approach</h3>
	<p>Having three clubs already signed up to the platform we needed to follow a process that would streamline every part of the design and development process - enter Atomic Design. This approach allowed for quicker wireframing and visual designs of templates for each club to sign off. It also made it simpler, building a design system for each club which in turn meant Front-end had a style guide to follow to keep everything consistent during the build.</p>
	<h3>Mobile First</h3>
	<p>Along with Atomic Design, working from a mobile first approach was also essential. Dealing with the smaller screen first meant the harder layout and design problems were dealt with earlier and allowed for a less problematic design phase. This was a massive time saver when it came to templates such as match centre, fixtures and player profiles.</p>

	<h2>Homepage</h2>
	<p>The homepage is built up of a number of different modules: Headline News, Latest News, Fixtures & Results, Videos, chosen Player Profile, Social feed, featured promotion and product carousel for the Online Shop. The idea being that the club can decide which modules to show and in what order, depending on their current focus and requirements. For example if they have just announced the new kit they may want the shop or promo module sitting higher up the page. Likewise if the season is over and there's no fixtures then they can turn the fixtures module off altogether.</p>
	<h3 class="template-features">Template features</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Content can be prioritised or removed by clubs themselves</li>
	<li>Set of customisable modules that cater for the fans' key user journeys.</li>
	<li>Showcase key signings or important club statements using the Breaking News module.</li>
	<li>Fully customisable shop module means clubs can promote anything from Kit ranges and training gear to Mother's/Father's day gifts.</li>
