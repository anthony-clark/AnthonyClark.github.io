	<h2>Creating a website to highlight everything that the island of Guernsey has to offer</h2>
	<div id="case-study-summary">
		<h3 class="template-features">The project</h3>
	<p>I was the lead designer on the Visit Guernsey project, coming up with wireframes and designs for each template to present back to the client for sign off. The website needed to be strikingly visual and improve upon the key user journeys such as planning your stay or how to get to the island. It needed to gel with improving Visit Guernsey's own yearly targets and aims.</p>

<div class="container narrow">
	<p>The idea behind the landing page was to clearly signpost the different search options to the users. The page introduces two different ways to search for a car depending on whether you already know what you are after, or you need help in finding the right car. My initial idea was to have these options on the actual search page as tabs, but whilst I was wireframing the page I felt this made the search page cluttered and harder to follow.Â People could also miss the tabs so I decided to introduce a landing page which would require users to make a decision, and depending on their choice, we would show them the relevant search page.
	</p><p>The header also allows returning users to easily access their messages, saved cars and previous searches.</p>

	<h3>Barclays Phonebook</h3>
	<p>The homepage was designed to be visually striking. I used brush strokes to give the website that coastal feel and chose colours from their brand guidelines that I felt worked best with each other. This resulted in a website that really stood out amongst its competitors.</p>
	
	<h4 class="template-features">Template features</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Striking hero imagery to push events</li>
	<li>Prominent promotions to push visitors into discovering Guernsey</li>

	<h3>Barclays Now mobile app</h3>
	<p>The Detail pages needed to really sell items such as accommodation. With this in mind we used hero images to allow Visit Guernsey to showcase items using beautiful large imagery to really show off each item, with more images accessible via an image gallery.</p>

	<p>Another target of Visit Guernsey was to promote ways of getting to the island. The getting here page was created to showcase the key ways to travel to Guernsey, either by specific plane and ferry companies or using a tour operator.</p>
		<p>The page needed to be a clean and simple promotional page that showed clearly each option for the visitor to browse.</p>
